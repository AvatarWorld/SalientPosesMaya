# SalientPoses - Maya Implementation

*Note: this is a work in progress, this documentation reflects my goal for the project rather than its current state.*

*Note: the tool currently handles a maximum of 200 dimensions (per frame), which is required to initialize arrays in the [OpenCL program](https://github.com/richard-roberts/SalientPosesPerformance/blob/master/src/kernel.cl#L22).*

This project implements the [Salient Poses](https://github.com/richard-roberts/PhD) algorithm as a plug-in for Maya. Please refer to [Details](#details) for more information about the design of the plug-in and to [Getting Started](#getting-started) for more information about obtaining and running this implementation.
